    "It is often said that deep learning models are \"black boxes\", learning representations that are difficult to extract and present in a human-readable form. While this is partially true for certain types of deep learning models, it is definitely not true for convnets. The representations learned by convnets are highly amenable to visualization, in large part because they are _representations of visual concepts_. Since 2013, a wide array of techniques have been developed for visualizing and interpreting these representations. We won't survey all of them, but we will cover three of the most accessible and useful ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualizing intermediate convnet outputs (\"intermediate activations\"). This is useful to understand how successive convnet layers transform their input, and to get a first idea of the meaning of individual convnet filters.\n",
    "* Visualizing convnets filters. This is useful to understand precisely what visual pattern or concept each filter in a convnet is receptive to.\n",
    "* Visualizing heatmaps of class activation in an image. This is useful to understand which part of an image where identified as belonging to a given class, and thus allows to localize objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first method -- activation visualization -- we will use the small convnet that we trained from scratch on the cat vs. dog classification problem two sections ago. For the next two methods, we will use the VGG16 model that we introduced in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizing intermediate activations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing intermediate activations consists in displaying the feature maps that are output by various convolution and pooling layers in a network, given a certain input (the output of a layer is often called its \"activation\", the output of the activation function). This gives a view into how an input is decomposed unto the different filters learned by the network. These feature maps we want to visualize have 3 dimensions: width, height, and depth (channels). Each channel encodes relatively independent features, so the proper way to visualize these feature maps is by independently plotting the contents of every channel, as a 2D image. Let's start by loading the model that we saved in section 5.2:"

    "\n",
    "* The first layer acts as a collection of various edge detectors. At that stage, the activations are still retaining almost all of the information present in the initial picture.\n",
    "* As we go higher-up, the activations become increasingly abstract and less visually interpretable. They start encoding higher-level concepts such as \"cat ear\" or \"cat eye\". Higher-up presentations carry increasingly less information about the visual contents of the image, and increasingly more information related to the class of the image.\n",
    "* The sparsity of the activations is increasing with the depth of the layer: in the first layer, all filters are activated by the input image, but in the following layers some filters are blank. This means that the pattern encoded by the filter isn't found in the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just evidenced a very important universal characteristic of the representations learned by deep neural networks: the features extracted by a layer get increasingly abstract with the depth of the layer. The activations of layers higher-up carry less and less information about the specific input being seen, and more and more information about the target (in our case, the class of the image: cat or dog). A deep neural network effectively acts as an __information distillation pipeline__, with raw data going in (in our case, RBG pictures), and getting repeatedly transformed so that irrelevant information gets filtered out (e.g. the specific visual appearance of the image) while useful information get magnified and refined (e.g. the class of the image).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to the way humans and animals perceive the world: after observing a scene for a few seconds, a human can remember which abstract objects were present in it (e.g. bicycle, tree) but could not remember the specific appearance of these objects. In fact, if you tried to draw a generic bicycle from mind right now, chances are you could not get it even remotely right, even though you have seen thousands of bicycles in your lifetime. Try it right now: this effect is absolutely real. You brain has learned to completely abstract its visual input, to transform it into high-level visual concepts while completely filtering out irrelevant visual details, making it \n",

    "These filter visualizations tell you a lot about how convnet layers see the world: each layer in a convnet learns a collection of filters such that their inputs can be expressed as a combination of the filters. This is similar to how the Fourier transform decomposes signals onto a bank of cosine functions. The filters in these convnet filter banks get increasingly complex and refined as you go higher in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The filters from the first layer in the model (`block1_conv1`) encode simple directional edges and colors (or colored edges in some cases).\n",
    "* The filters from `block2_conv1` encode simple textures made from combinations of edges and colors.\n",

    "We'll introduce one more visualization technique: one that is useful for understanding which parts of a given image led a convnet to its final classification decision. This is helpful for debugging the decision process of a convnet, particularly in the case of a classification mistake. It also allows you to locate specific objects in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This general category of techniques is called _class activation map_ (CAM) visualization, and it consists of producing heatmaps of class activation over input images. A class-activation heatmap is a 2D grid of scores associated with a specific output class, computed for every location in any input image, indicating how important each location is with respect to the class under consideration. For instance, given an image fed into a cat-versus-dog convnet, CAM visualization allows you to generate a heatmap for the class \"cat,\" indicating how cat-like different parts of the image are, and also a heatmap for the class \"dog,\" indicating how dog-like parts of the image are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific implementation you'll use is the one described in \"Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization.\"footnote:[Ramprasaath R. Selvaraju et al., Cornell University Library, March 21, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391.]. It's very simple: it consists of taking the output feature map of a convolution layer, given an input image, and weighing every channel in that feature map by the gradient of the class with respect to the channel. Intuitively, one way to understand this trick is that you're weighting a spatial map of \"how intensely the input image activates different channels\" by \"how important each channel is with regard to the class,\" resulting in a spatial map of \"how intensely the input image activates the class.\"\n",
