The convolution window is a 1D window on the temporal axis: the second axis in the input tensor.\n",

    "The validation MAE stays in the 0.40s: you can't even beat the common-sense baseline using the small convnet. Again, this is because the convnet looks for patterns anywhere in the input timeseries and has no knowledge of the temporal position of a pattern it sees (toward the beginning, toward the end, and so on). Because more recent data points should be interpreted differently from older datapoints in the case of this specific forecasting problem, the convnet fails at producing meaningful results. This limitation of convnets isn't an issue with the IMDB data, because patterns of keywords associated with a positive or negative sentiment are informative independently of where they're found in the input sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to combine the speed and lightness of convnets with the order-sensitivity of RNNs is to use a 1D convnet as a preprocessing step before a RNN (see figure 6.30). This is especially beneficial when you're dealing with sequences that are so long they can't realistically be processed with RNNs, such as sequences with thousands of steps. The convnet will turn the long input sequence into much shorter (downsampled) sequences of higher-level features. This sequence of extracted features then becomes the input to the RNN part of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique isn't seen often in research papers and practical applications, possibly because it isn't well known. It's effective and ought to be more common. Let's try it on the temperature-forecasting dataset. Because this strategy allows you to manipulate much longer sequences, you can either look at data from longer ago (by increasing the `lookback` parameter of the data generator) or look at high-resolution timeseries (by decreasing the `step` parameter of the generator). Here, somewhat arbitrarily, you'll use a `step` that's half as large, resulting in a timeseries twice as long, where the weather data is sampled at a rate of 1 point per 30 minutes. The example reuses the `generator` function defined earlier.\n"
