    "As a reminder, in chapter 3, the first naive approach to this dataset got you to a test accuracy of 88%. Unfortunately, this small recurrent network doesn't perform well compared to this baseline (only 84% validation accuracy). Part of the problem is that your inputs only consider the first 500 words, rather than full sequences -- hence the RNN has access to less information than the earlier baseline model. The remainder of the problem is that `layer_simple_rnn()`  isn't good at processing long sequences, such as text. Other types of recurrent layers perform much better. Let's look at some more advanced layers.\n",

We only specify the output dimensionality of the LSTM layer, and leave every  other argument (there are lots) to the Keras defaults. Keras has good defaults, and things will almost always \"just work\" without you having to spend time tuning parameters by hand."
