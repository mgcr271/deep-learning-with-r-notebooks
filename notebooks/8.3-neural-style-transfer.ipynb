    "Besides Deep Dream, another major development in deep learning-driven image modification that happened in the summer of 2015 is neural style transfer, introduced by Leon Gatys et al. The neural style transfer algorithm has undergone many refinements and spawned many variations since its original introduction, including a viral smartphone app, called Prisma. For simplicity, this section focuses on the formulation described in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural style transfer consists in applying the \"style\" of a reference image to a target image, while conserving the \"content\" of the target image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![style transfer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/book.keras.io/img/ch8/style_transfer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What is meant by \"style\" is essentially textures, colors, and visual patterns in the image, at various spatial scales, while the \"content\" is the higher-level macrostructure of the image. For instance, blue-and-yellow circular brush strokes are considered to be the \"style\" in the above example using Starry Night by Van Gogh, while the buildings in the Tuebingen photograph are considered to be the \"content\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of style transfer, tightly related to that of texture generation, has had a long history in the image processing community prior to the development of neural style transfer in 2015. However, as it turned out, the deep learning-based implementations of style transfer offered results unparalleled by what could be previously achieved with classical computer vision techniques, and triggered an amazing renaissance in creative applications of computer vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key notion behind implementing style transfer is same idea that is central to all deep learning algorithms: we define a loss function to specify what we want to achieve, and we minimize this loss. We know what we want to achieve: conserve the \"content\" of the original image, while adopting the \"style\" of the reference image. If we were able to mathematically define content and style, then an appropriate loss function to minimize would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "loss <- distance(style(reference_image) - style(generated_image)) +\n",
    "        distance(content(original_image) - content(generated_image))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `distance` is a norm function such as the L2 norm, `content` is a function that takes an image and computes a representation of its \"content\", and `style` is a function that takes an image and computes a representation of its \"style\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing this loss would cause `style(generated_image)` to be close to `style(reference_image)`, while `content(generated_image)` would be close to `content(generated_image)`, thus achieving style transfer as we defined it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental observation made by Gatys et al is that deep convolutional neural networks offer precisely a way to mathematically defined the `style` and `content` functions. Let's see how.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The content loss\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, activations from earlier layers in a network contain _local_ information about the image, while activations from higher layers contain increasingly _global_ and _abstract_ information. Formulated in a different way, the activations of the different layers of a convnet provide a decomposition of the contents of an image over different spatial scales. Therefore we expect the \"content\" of an image, which is more global and more abstract, to be captured by the representations of a top layer of a convnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good candidate for a content loss would thus be to consider a pre-trained convnet, and define as our loss the L2 norm between the activations of a top layer computed over the target image and the activations of the same layer computed over the generated image. This would guarantee that, as seen from the top layer of the convnet, the generated image will \"look similar\" to the original target image. Assuming that what the top layers of a convnet see is really the \"content\" of their input images, then this does work as a way to preserve \n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "While the content loss only leverages a single higher-up layer, the style loss as defined in the Gatys et al. paper leverages multiple layers of a convnet: we aim at capturing the appearance of the style reference image at all spatial scales extracted by the convnet, not just any single scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the style loss, the Gatys et al. paper leverages the \"Gram matrix\" of a layer's activations, i.e. the inner product between the feature maps of a given layer. This inner product can be understood as representing a map of the correlations between the features of a layer. These feature correlations capture the statistics of the patterns of a particular spatial scale, which empirically corresponds to the appearance of the textures found at this scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the style loss aims at preserving similar internal correlations within the activations of different layers, across the style reference image and the generated image. In turn, this guarantees that the textures found at different spatial scales will look similar across the style reference image and the generated image.\n",
