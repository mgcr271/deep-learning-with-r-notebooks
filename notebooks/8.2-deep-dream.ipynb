    "We will start from a convnet pre-trained on ImageNet. In Keras, we have many such convnets available: VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50... albeit the same process is doable with any of these, your convnet of choice will naturally affect your visualizations, since different convnet architectures result in different learned features. The convnet used in the original Deep Dream release was an Inception model, and in practice Inception is known to produce very nice-looking Deep Dreams, so we will use the InceptionV3 model that comes with Keras."

    "Next, we compute the \"loss\", the quantity that we will seek to maximize during the gradient ascent process. In Chapter 5, for filter visualization, we were trying to maximize the value of a specific filter in a specific layer. Here we will simultaneously maximize the activation of all filters in a number of layers. Specifically, we will maximize a weighted sum of the L2 norm of the activations of a set of high-level layers. The exact set of layers we pick (as well as their contribution to the final loss) has a large influence on the visuals that we will be able to produce, so we want to make these parameters easily configurable. Lower layers result in geometric patterns, while higher layers result in visuals in which you can recognize some classes from ImageNet (e.g. birds or dogs). We'll start from a somewhat arbitrary configuration involving four layers -- but you will definitely want to explore many different configurations later on:"

Given a small image S and a larger image size L, we can compute the difference between the original image (assumed larger than L) resized to size L and the original resized to size S -- this difference quantifies the details lost when going from S to L."
