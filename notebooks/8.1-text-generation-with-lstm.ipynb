You could use any sufficiently large text file or set of text files -- Wikipedia, the Lord of the Rings, etc. In this example we will use some of the writings of Nietzsche, the late-19th century German philosopher (translated to English).

With higher temperatures, the generated text becomes more interesting, surprising, even creative; it may sometimes invent completely new words that sound somewhat plausible (such as \"eterned\" or \"troveration\"). With a high temperature, the local structure starts breaking down and most words look like semi-random strings of characters. Without a doubt, here 0.5 is the most interesting temperature for text generation in this specific setup. Always experiment with multiple sampling strategies! A clever balance between learned structure and randomness is what makes generation interesting.\n",

But of course, don't expect to ever generate any meaningful text, other than by random chance: all we are doing is sampling data from a statistical model of which characters come after which characters. Language is a communication channel, and there is a distinction between what communications are about, and the statistical structure of the messages in which communications are encoded. To evidence this distinction, here is a thought experiment: what if human language did a better job at compressing communications, much like our computers do with most of our digital communications? Then language would be no less meaningful, yet it would lack any intrinsic statistical structure, thus making it impossible to learn a language model like we just did."
