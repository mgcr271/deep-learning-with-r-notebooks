The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input data (a column in the input data matrix), you subtract the mean of the feature and divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature is centered around 0 and has a unit standard deviation. This is easily done in R using the `scale()` function."

A consequence is that our validation scores may change a lot depending on _which_ data points we choose to use for validation and which we choose for training, i.e. the validation scores may have a high _variance_ with regard to the validation split.
